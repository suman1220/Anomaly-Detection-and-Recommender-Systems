# Anomaly-Detection-and-Recommender-Systems

This project implements two key machine learning concepts: anomaly detection and recommender systems. Anomaly detection is used to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior. In this project, it's applied to network intrusion detection, fraud detection. The recommender system part of the project aims to predict user preferences and recommend items accordingly, and it's demonstrated on movie recommendations.

Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems
Overview
This project encompasses the development and implementation of two distinct machine learning applications: Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems. Specifically, the Anomaly Detection component is designed to identify unusual data points in a dataset which can be pivotal for fraud detection, network security, or fault detection systems. The Recommender System part utilizes collaborative filtering to provide personalized recommendations to users, demonstrated within the context of a movie recommendation engine.

Features
Anomaly Detection: Implementation of an algorithm capable of identifying aberrant data points within a dataset.
Recommender System: A system built to understand user preferences and recommend items by predicting user ratings.

Datasets
The project utilizes two primary datasets:

Anomaly Detection Dataset: This dataset contains movie recommendations.
